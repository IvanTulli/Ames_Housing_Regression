This is a practice exercise in which a simple neural network is used to solve a regression problem to predict house pricing, using the Ames Housing Database.
This was used for the practice Kaggle competition called "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques". 
The code in the notebook is meant to be run in Colab.
